# Online Messaging Service for CS50w

This project is a online messaging service (similar to Slack) built in Flask using SocketIO for the communication.

To setup the website, start 'run.sh', which installs all requirements (see 'requirements.txt' for the list), sets the secret key, and starts the python application. 

The main application can be found in 'application.py'. Css and javascript files are located in the 'static' folder. As well, all html templates can be found in the 'templates' folder. 

I have included the ability to leave chat rooms and logout (allowing users to select different usernames). Furthermore, the chat room will alert everyone on the channel when someone has entered or left.
